## spvt - The Supvime Terminal

Since writing your own text editor from the very beginning turned out to be more difficult than it looks, I decided to use great text rendering and graphic front-end for another project: a terminal emulator. That said, development of [Supvime](https://github.com/ruslashev/supvime) will not be slowed.
